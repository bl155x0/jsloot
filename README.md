# jsloot üêø

`jsloot` is a handy tool designed to download and beautify JavaScript files, often used alongside your favorite offensive web proxy.

## Purpose

The main goal of `jsloot` is to collect, download, and beautify JavaScript files while manually investigating a target with a web proxy. 
As you browse your target manually, jsloot automatically collects JavaScript URLs to a local file, making them ready for further investigation.

## Setup

```bash
go install github.com/bl155x0/jsloot@latest
```

### Dependencies

To beautify JavaScript files, you'll need [jsbeautifier](https://pypi.org/project/jsbeautifier/). Install it with:

```bash
pip install jsbeautifier
```

### Caido

To seamlessly integrate `jsloot` with Caido, install the following passive Workflow to your Caido project:

https://github.com/bl155x0/caido/tree/main/workflows/passive/JSLoot


# Usage
`jsloot` offers two distinct sub-commands:


### `add`
The `add` command is used to collect JavaScript URLs while investigating a target with a proxy tool like Caido. 
It appends JavaScript URLs to a text file (jsloot.txt).

```bash
jsloot add -f jsloot.txt http://example.com/main.js
```
If the Caido passive Workflow is installed (see [Caido](#Caido)), this command is executed automatically,
for every recognized JavaScript file while browsing your target with Caido.

### `loot`

The `loot` command downloads and beautifies all collected JavaScript ULRs to a local folder.
``` bash
jsloot loot -f jsloot.txt
```
